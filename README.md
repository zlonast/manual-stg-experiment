# manual-stg-experiment

Manually constructed STG programs compiled with the standard GHC codegen backend.  

The samples show various use cases i.e. (de)construction of (un)boxed tuples and (un)lifted ADTs and using FFI.  

This experiment suggests that GHC codegen and RTS can be used as generic compiler backend for strict and lazy functional languages.

### Build

```
cabal setup
cabal build
```

### Usage

```
cabal repl StgSample.hs
```

Run a sample in GHCi. i.e.

```
*StgSample> sampleADT2
```

It will generate an executable named `a.out` also will generate the intermediate output files (`out.ll`, `out.s`, `out.o`).
